## Basic understanding of JavaScript
------

This is a school task created to see if the student is able to perform the basic programming concepts associated with modern front-end development.

### Task: Create a Todo list application written in HTML, CSS & JavaScript
#### 1 - Write hand written HTML markup.
---

#### 2 - Apply a modern mobile-first focused framework, for ex: Bootstrap, Foundation or jQuery Mobile.
---
It is important to have an aesthetically pleasing application in form of color and shape, but it is also important that the user experience is a good experience.

  I will use **Foundation for Sites (6)** because i want to:

  1. Try the framework... Last time i used Zurb Foundation it was on version nr: 4.
  2. Have a solid CSS framework as... foundation... pun intended. So that i am able to:
  3. Continue to develop my todo list in the future.
  4. Get some layout and design help from the framework but i will handwrite most of the CSS affecting this project.

#### 3 - Implement the following functionality in the todo list application with the help of JavaScript
---
  1. Add
      * User writes task 'go shopping'.
      * User push add new task button
      * Task is added to a incomplete tasks list
  2. Change
      * User press button to edit added task
      * Task can now be edited
      * User writes new text in edit mode
      * User push save button to save edit text to added task
      * Task can now NOT be edited
  3. Mark task as complete
      * User push completed task button
      * Task is moved from incomplete tasks list to a completed tasks list
      * Task is no longer a child of incomplete tasks list
      * Task now only have one button, delete task button
